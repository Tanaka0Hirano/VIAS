# How the version works on this project?
Version (D as Developer Test) = total code / 2000
convert decimal number to regular number
+ by now the version is 13242 / 2000 = 6.621 or 7 (soon will be D7)

# For Programmers
in .cpp, you'll see alot of code are closed due to error, will be interruped while processing or perform a task and yet to update.
