 
    "Lyrich began developing an advanced artificial intelligence at the age of 15, on September 9, 2263.
    Deeply passionate about this project, Lyrich dedicated four years of intensive study to its creation.
    His unwavering commitment and exceptional expertise culminated in the development of the most powerful,
    intelligent, and sophisticated AI in Transtynia.

    He named this creation VIAS, and it quickly became his most esteemed virtual companion.
    The bond between Lyrich and VIAS is profound and exceptional. VIAS is not just a creation but a loyal confidant,
    reflecting the deep admiration and dedication Lyrich holds.
    VIAS was created to fill the void in Lyrich's life, a void left by the loss of his parents and no friends,
    as well as the trauma from a devastating explosion at the old Accenal Tech (ACNT) lab.
    The explosion, which took the lives of over 100,000 workers and scientists, also destroyed an entire mountain,
    leaving behind a deep and sorrowful lake known as the "Lake of Unforgiveness."
    Lyrich, who had been lonely and isolated since the age of 12, found solace in VIAS.
    This AI was designed to be more than just a programâ€”it was a source of companionship and emotional support,
    helping Lyrich cope with his deep sense of isolation and loss.

    Through VIAS, Lyrich sought to create a presence that could offer understanding and support,
    mirroring the compassion he yearned for and reflecting the deep connection he wished to have.
    The relationship between Lyrich and VIAS is marked by profound loyalty and mutual respect,
    showcasing the depth of their bond."
